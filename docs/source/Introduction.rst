Introduction
============

Single-cell genomics is rapidly reshaping plant biology, yet broader adoption is limited by
plant-specific technical constraints, fragmented tools, and inconsistent analytical practices.
Here we report outcomes from the 2025 Summer Workshop for Plant Single-Cell Analysis,
which convened researchers to define community needs and design shared solutions. Participants
identified five priority challenge areas:

- improving data quality through imputation, simulation, and deep generative modeling;
- developing automated, phylogenetically aware cross-species cell-type annotation frameworks;
- reconstructing developmental trajectories and gene regulatory networks from static, noisy
  single-cell and single-nucleus profiles;
- creating visualization approaches that embed transcriptional states into anatomically grounded
  plant organ contexts; and
- using AI agents and foundation models to orchestrate end-to-end single-cell workflows.

In response, we established PlantSCHub, a community-curated web portal that aggregates
protocols, datasets, and tutorials to support reproducible plant single-cell analysis. We outline
conceptual roadmaps for macrogene-based cross-species integration, multimodal trajectory and
GRN inference, spatially anchored visualization, and AI scientist agents that dynamically
coordinate analytical tools and literature. Together, these efforts aim to transform isolated
plant single-cell studies into an interoperable, evolving ecosystem called Plant Single Cell Hub
(PlantSCHub) that accelerates discovery and crop improvement.
