Welcome to Plant Single Cell Hub!
===================================

**PlantSCHub** is a community-curated, open knowledge hub designed to support reproducible and scalable analysis of plant single-cell and single-nucleus genomics data. It brings together protocols, datasets, tutorials, and recommended computational workflows to address plant-specific challenges such as data quality, cross-species cell-type annotation, developmental trajectory inference, visualization, and AI-enabled analysis. By consolidating fragmented resources into a living, FAIR-aligned ecosystem, PlantSCHub aims to lower technical barriers, promote best practices, and accelerate discovery across diverse plant species, tissues, and experimental systems.
