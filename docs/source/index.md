__PlantSCHub__ is a community-curated hub for reproducible plant single-cell analysis. It centralizes practical bioinformatics workflows and protocols for analyzing single-cell and single-nucleus data, helping researchers address plant-specific technical and analytical challenges. In addition to curated datasets and publications, PlantSCHub provides links to relevant databases, published visualization methods, and educational resources such as tutorials and YouTube videos. The platform also maintains a growing catalog of published plant single-cell datasets and supports community contributions to expand and sustain this shared resource.
