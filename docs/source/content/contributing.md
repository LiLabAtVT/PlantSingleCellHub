# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PlantSCHub! We welcome contributions from the community — whether you are adding a new protocol, improving documentation, reporting an issue, or submitting code.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report issues**: Open issues on the GitHub repository to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements.
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation under the `docs/` directory (this site). Clear, reproducible examples and step-by-step protocols are especially valuable.
- **Pull requests**: Submit a PR with a clear description of your changes and link to any related issues. Keep PRs focused and small when possible.

## Guidelines

- Use clear commit messages and include an explanatory description in PRs.
- Follow existing formatting and style in the repository. For code contributions, prefer readable, well-documented changes.
- For protocols or data contributions, include provenance (publication, DOI, or dataset link) and any usage/processing notes.
